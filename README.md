## Defining a chatbot

An interface to get a task done via a text or voice based conversation with a robot, sometimes aided by a human. It’s simply not a machine masquerading as an individual, but actually a new interface after the GUI, in some circles being referred to as a CUI (Conversational User Interface).

## Why?

For quering or order placement specification use cases, etc, the uses and requirement of a chatbot is limitless. Almost all businesses, whether service or product related use chatbots for quering, FAQs, and other consulting depending on the use case.


## How?

 Through Machine Learning algorithms and regular expressions, chatbots can learn appropriate answers to specific user queries over time, for which they no longer require training. But the actual impact of this miraculous technology can be witnessed only if the user is able to understand what the chatbot says and likes it. It’s like interacting with your user and the difference between saying “Comfortable & Luxurious 4 seater convertible car” v/s a “a contraption, powered by an turbo charged internal combustion engine and able to carry 4 objects of max 90 Kg each.” Well designed chatbots are always use-case driven and have a personality.
 
 # Building
 
 ## Preprocessing
 
 ### Gathering Conversational Training data
 
 For every machine learning program, it requires a data set to train it, for our purposes, a .csv file is used containing conversational data to be trained
 
 ### Cleaning and formatting data 
 
Formating the data so that the data can be processed easily and only useful data is used to train the model.
